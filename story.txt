Far far away there existed a bearded man named pico, he was spanish and loved tacos, he lived in Egypt.
His favorite thing to do in the whole world was to go scuba diving. Although he could rarely do this as Egypt is not the ideal place for scuba diving.
Therefore he usually went to Australia to scuba dive. His favorite place to scuba dive was the great barrier reef. He liked it so much that he decided to move to Australia later in his life.
He now lives there and married a local Australian surfer, and is happily raising a family in melbourne.

They grew old together. They loved each other very much. They consinued to have children.
By the time they were 60 they had managed to produce 149 children. This is not what they
had bargained for. There were just too many people in the house. Each child had 2 surf
boards. Can you believe that? thats 298 surf boards non including the ones owned
by the parents. That's a lot of surf boards.
