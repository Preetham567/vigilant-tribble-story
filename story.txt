Far far away there existed a bearded man named pico, he was spanish and loved tacos, he lived in Egypt.
His favorite thing to do in the whole world was to go scuba diving. Although he could rarely do this as Egypt is not the ideal place for scuba diving.
Therefore he usually went to Australia to scuba dive. His favorite place to scuba dive was the great barrier reef. He liked it so much that he decided to move to Australia later in his life.
He now lives there and married a local Australian surfer, and is happily raising a family in melbourne.
